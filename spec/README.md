# 📐 Spec Index

All design documents for `my-mcp-server` live here.
Each folder contains a `design.md` and any supporting diagrams.

---

| Folder | What it covers |
|--------|---------------|
| [`01-architecture/`](./01-architecture/design.md) | Overall server architecture — Tools, Resources, Prompts, transport layer |
| [`02-llm-client/`](./02-llm-client/design.md) | Gemini-powered MCP client — how the LLM connects to the server |

---

> **Convention:** Add a new numbered folder for each major design area.
> e.g. `03-calendar-integration/`, `04-auth/`, etc.
